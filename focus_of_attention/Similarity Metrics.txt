Image Similarity Metrics - For all these metrics a
higher number is a better result.

Area under ROC Curve created by Judd:
Measured as the proportion of saliency map values
above a threshold at the fixation locations to the
number of values below the threshold at the fixation
locations.

Area under ROC Curve by Borji:
Measure the proportion of true positives to false
positives, which are the values in the saliency map
above a threshold that do not correspond to a fixation
location.

Similarity Measure:
Treats each map as a distribution and computes
the histogram intersection.

Correlation Coefficient:
Pearson's linear cofficient between the two maps.

Normalized Scanpath Saliency:
Refers to the mean value of the normalized saliency
map at fixation locations.
